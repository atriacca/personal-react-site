I think what I feel fortunate about is that I am still astonished – that things still amaze me. And I think that that’s a great benefit of being in the arts, where the possibility for learning never disappears; where you basically have to admit you never learn it.
by Milton Glaser

Design is a mix of craft, science, storytelling, propaganda, and philosophy.

A customer is the most important visitor on our premises.
He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him.
He is not an interruption of our work. He is the purpose of it.
He is not an outsider to our business. He is part of it.
We are not doing him a favour by serving him.
He is doing us a favour by giving us the opportunity to do so.
by Mahatma Ghandi

Design is a mix of craft, science, storytelling, propaganda, and philosophy.

The secret of success is doing something you love, doing it well and being recognized for it.
